# A simple template for a simple site

Life can seem fast and overwhelming. Sometimes, we need to slow down. That is why this template exists.

You certainly do not need to ascribe to the principles of [slow living](https://www.slowlivingldn.com/what-is-slow-living/) to use this template. But if you like the design, you may want to look into the movement.

This template should work well on all devices, so you can focus on creating great content. And it was designed to work with the static site generator [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll), so you can own and control the content you create.

If you are comfortable with someone else hosting your content, and want an easier way to use this blog style, please [visit the original Bear Blog](https://bearblog.dev/). They offer a hosting service.

What happens when you combine a simple template with a simple engine?

Only you can tell us. Made with ❤️ by [hmk](https://www.heimark.org).
